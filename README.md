# Soozen, an advanced timer app ‚è±Ô∏è

Soozen is a productivity-focused timer app built with **Flutter**. It allows users to set timers with customizable targets, track their progress by checking off tasks during the timer, and view detailed logs of completed targets with timestamps. All data is stored locally using **Hive Database**, ensuring fast performance and offline functionality.
